# TIC TAC TOE USING C LANGUAGE 

In this assigment we want to create a computer program that allows two people to play a variation of "Tic Tac Toc" with each other.
The rules are simple: Tic Tac Toe is played on an N by N grid. Two players play, one can place X’s on the board, the other O’s. The player who obtains N X’s (or N O’s) in a row – vertical, horizontal, or diagonal – wins. The program should be able to handle N =3, 4, 5, …, 8.
The computer’s job is to keep track of the moves that the players make, inform them if anyone has won, and prevent them from making incorrect moves. It should first ask player "one" to make a move, asking for the row and column of where the "X" is to be placed. Then it should do the same for player "two", placing an "O" in the appropriate row and column. It should alternately ask the players, checking after each move if a player has won (or if the game is over because there’s no more room let to place a piece).
